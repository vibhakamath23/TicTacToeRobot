# PROBLEM 

The chosen challenge of this project was to create a system using an XRP that could play at least one move of a tic tac toe exchange against a human opponent. 
The purpose of defining this goal was to gain more experience in dexterous control, precise movement on a small scale, and camera vision. 

**Required Components:**

- XRP needs to show autonomous behavior
- At least one camera
- MQTT server for robot-operator or robot-robot communication
- Multiple “stages”
- Have a human user input
- Use formal control methods such as state machines, behaviors-based control, or behavior trees
- Use some form of localization (e.g., line following, wall following, APRIL tag detection, forward kinematics, sensor fusion, etc.)

# APPROACH

See folder of project images here for components and setup: 

Across two separate workspaces, this project works by using a single file for game logic ('TicTacToeGame.py') that uses an eye-in-the-sky camera and a tic tac 
toe board made of April Tags.
